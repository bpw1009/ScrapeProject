# ScrapeProject
This was a group project for the graduate UNH Analytics department. The group members were Ben Weckerle, Devan Miller, and Johnny Cagno. 

The project requirements were to scrape data from the internet and to apply a some sort of machine learning model or other data science techniques. 

We chose to scrape job postings and then, after pre-processing the data, run two different topic modeling techniques--Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Nonzero Matrix Factorization(NMF).
